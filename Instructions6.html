<p>The goal of this pair of assignments is to practice researching an unfamiliar topic of moderate complexity, critical evaluation, and presenting your conclusions. This assignment is to be completed in groups of 2 or 3. Each group has 10 minutes for the presentation and has to be prepared to answer questions for 2 minutes. The previous groups will remain, unless you request a different group; please contact our TA Khaled, zakik@mcmaster.ca, in that case; members of a group have to be of the same tutorial section. You can choose one of the following topics or come up with your own topic. However, the topic has to be approved by the instructor, emil@mcmaster.ca.</p>
<ol>
<li>Compare assertions in Eiffel to assertions in Java/C/python (your choice)</li>
<li>Compare documentation in Eiffel to JavaDoc</li>
<li>Compare literate programming with LEP to Doxygen</li>
<li>Compare documentation with CWEB to documentation with Haskell</li>
<li>Compare verification with Java PathFinder to verification with OpenJML</li>
<li>Compare verification of Java programs with the jstar to verification of C# programs with Spec#</li>
<li>Compare techniques and tools for program obfuscation (serious, not recreational)</li>
<li>Compare methods for energy conservation, esp. mobile devices</li>
<li>Compare Knuth-Morris-Pratt with Boyer-Moore string search</li>
<li>Compare concurrency in Erlang to concurrency in Java/C# (your choice)</li>
<li>Compare concurrency in Google&rsquo;s GO to concurrency in C#</li>
<li>Compare cross-development for tablets to TouchDevelop from Microsoft Research</li>
<li>Compare consistency of cloud storage: Microsoft Azure vs Amazon S3</li>
<li>Compare map &amp; reduce in functional languages (ocaml/Haskell, your choice) to MapReduce in Hadoop/Google</li>
<li>Compare relational databases (DB2, mysql) to stream computing (IBM&rsquo;s InfoSphere Streams)</li>
<li>Compare SQL databases to the MongoDB NoSQL data store</li>
<li>Compare pair programming to code inspection</li>
<li>[several topics] Compare two of the following tools for static analysis:<br />findbugs.sourceforge.net<br />www.coverity.com<br />research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/<br />developers.google.com/java-dev-tools/codepro/doc/<br />checkstyle.sourceforge.net<br />msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff549179.aspx<br />clang-analyzer.llvm.org (needs Mac OS X)<br />pmd.sourceforge.net</li>
</ol>
<p>All presentations of one tutorial session have to be on distinct topics. Please confirm your preferred topic with our TA Khaled, zakik@mcmaster.ca, by Friday, Nov 8.</p>
<p><strong>Written Assignment</strong></p>
<p>Write a report of 4 - 8 pages &mdash; brevity is valued but depending on the topic, a longer report may be more adequate. The report has to have an introduction, main part, conclusions, and must cite all references. The first page should state the title of the report and all group members. The introduction, half a page to a page, should give a background that orients the reader, establish the need for the report by revealing a gap or problem worth addressing, show how the report fills the gap by stating the specific purpose, and provide an overview of the document&rsquo;s organization; see the course notes on Engineering Communication. The main part has first to introduce the topic in sufficient depth and then compare the approaches or tools. When comparing X to Y, the state the criteria for comparison, discuss what is similar and what is different, and why so. The conclusion, of half a page to a page, draws consequences from the comparison, for example, why one would prefer one over the other, when one would prefer one over the other, without repeating the main part. Use credible arguments and rhetorical patterns as in the course notes on Engineering Communication. A report that simply rephrases material on X and Y without setting them properly in relation is not satisfactory. The report will be judged on the language, how well it is typeset, adequacy of figures, clarity of explanations, proper structure, conciseness and convincingness of arguments, adequacy of references.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Late Policy</span></strong></p>
<p>If you select your topic later than Friday, Nov 8, a 20% penalty applies.</p>
<p>For this written assignment, we deviate from the course outline and will enforce the following policy.</p>
<p>up to 24 hours late, 30% penalty<br />up to 48 hours late, 60% penalty<br />after 48 hours no submissions are accepted and a 0 will be assigned</p>
<p><strong>Oral Presentation</strong></p>
<p>The oral presentation has to present all parts of the written report. The criteria that were set out earlier in the course apply. In particular, you should assume that the audience consists of second year Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Math students.</p>
<p>The oral presentations will take place during your tutorial section starting Monday, November 25 and will continue over the next three weeks. Please submit your request and have it confirmed by Friday, November 8. A preliminary presentation schedule will be released on Monday, November 30. The presentations will be stretched over two tutorial sessions. You will only be required to attend the session that you will present in but feel free to attend the others.</p>
<p>You can use digital slides, the projector and the black(white)board. Digital slides must be in either pdf or ppt format and must be submitted via Avenue's dropbox by 10pm the day before your scheduled presentation. The class computer will be used to project any digital material submitted. If you want to use tools other than the computer, please ensure that you come with your required material (markers, chalk, etc) to avoid disappointment. We will not be responsible for your inability to present due to lack of available materials.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>
