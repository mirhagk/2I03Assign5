\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
A huge problem that many software companies are running into is that as their programmers leave the company the code that they had written becomes unmanageable since no one know what the code does exactly. This is because at the time code was written to be able accomplish the task that needed to be done and no one bothered to make their code so that others we able to read and understand what their code did.

The solution to combat unreadable code was to have more than one person work on the code. The thought process behind this was that if more than one person worked to create the code then the code would be much more readable than if only one person worked on the code. This is because in order to make the code more than one person had to understand what was going on while making the code. There are multiple method of doing this each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this report we are going to compare \PP and \CR.

In this document we shall be comparing \PP and \CR in the following categories.
\begin{itemize}
\item Code Quality
\item Cost and Productivity
\item Difficulty in managing
\end{itemize}

In each of these categories we will talk about what is similar and what is different between \PP and \CR

\subsection{Cost and Productivity}

Software developers are not free, nor are they cheap, so cost is a big factor in choosing the software design process. An inexperienced manager who doesn't understand programming might see both processes as additional expense.Upon suggesting \PP to management, many software developers are faced with "But then it'll cost twice as much", or equivalently "But then productivity will halve". \CR is also seen as wasting time as well, but it's usually easier to justify, and isn't usually seen as doubling time amount of time required.

Despite what some might think, neither one doubles cost, or halves productivity. In the long run both of them increase productivity because they increase code quality, and increase the number of developers who understand a section of code. Having multiple developers understand a section of code means that if one developer goes on vacation or leaves the workplace, the code can still be maintained and fixed.

\subsection{Difficulty in Managing}
