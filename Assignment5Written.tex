\subsection{Cost and Productivity}

Software developers are not free, nor are they cheap, so cost is a big factor in choosing the software design process. An inexperienced manager who doesn't understand programming might see both processes as additional expense.Upon suggesting \PP to management, many software developers are faced with "But then it'll cost twice as much", or equivalently "But then productivity will halve". \CR is also seen as wasting time as well, but it's usually easier to justify, and isn't usually seen as doubling time amount of time required.

Despite what some might think, neither one doubles cost, or halves productivity. In the long run both of them increase productivity because they increase code quality, and increase the number of developers who understand a section of code. Having multiple developers understand a section of code means that if one developer goes on vacation or leaves the workplace, the code can still be maintained and fixed.
